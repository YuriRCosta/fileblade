# The drag is a democtl script inside the guest, a real pointer from press to
# release. Space is held by demos/hold-space-near.sh from the pushed plugin: it
# waits until the pointer comes within REACH px of the drop point, then holds
# Space for HOLD ms. A small reach on an eased path opens the wheel where the
# drag ends, so the release lands on the hub; a large reach on a linear path
# opens it REACH px early, so the release lands on the wedge in the direction
# of travel. While the recording runs the host polls the status document and
# keeps two snapshots: the first that shows the wheel open, for the drag facts,
# and the first that shows its rows loaded, for the target; the backend answers
# a moment after the wheel appears, often after the release.
